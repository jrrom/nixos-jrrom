# jrrom's NixOS / Void Linux Configuration

## Philosophy

I wanted my configuration to be simple, easy-to-understand and with less moving parts. I am generally not a big fan of configuration and prefer sane defaults. More complex Nix expressions may be added in the future, but for now this will suffice. I wanted the foundation to be minimalistic to allow me to save brain space to focus on a more maximalist development environment.

I started out with NixOS but due to difficulties faced with FHS compatibility I have switched to Void Linux. I am using standalone Home Manager to keep all my config files centralised. Consider the NixOS directory of this repository deprecated.

If you find an issue in this repository, please kindly contribute and help me fix it.
