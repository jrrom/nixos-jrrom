# jrrom's NixOS Configuration

## Philosophy

I wanted my configuration to be simple, easy-to-understand and with less moving parts. I am generally not a big fan of configuration and prefer sane defaults. More complex Nix expressions may be added in the future, but for now this will suffice. I wanted the foundation to be minimalistic to allow me to save brain space to focus on a more maximalist development environment.

If you find an issue in this repository, please kindly contribute and help me fix it.
